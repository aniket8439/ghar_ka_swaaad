    <p>Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around  the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a  revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom,  cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they  help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.

    <h3>Top 10 Indian Vegetables Dishes</h3>

      <img src="chana_masala.jpg"  class="dish"  height="300" alt="Chana_Masala" >
      <p>
        Chana masala recipe – Chana masala is a delicious & flavorful Indian curry made by 
        cooking chickpeas in a spicy onion tomato masala gravy. It can be eaten with basmati rice, 
        roti, naan, poori, Bhatura and plain parathas or even with flavored rice like jeera rice or ghee 
        rice. <br>
      </p>
      

      <li class="palak_Paneer">Palak Paneer</li>
      <img src="Palak_paneer.jpg" class="dish" height = "300" alt="Palak_paneer" >
      <p>
        It was such a great way to sneak in the greens. They wouldn’t touch spinach otherwise but if 
        there was paneer with it, they would happily gulp down bowls of it. <br>
        Palak Paneer is such a staple in north India. It’s one of the most commonly made paneer 
        dishes in Indian homes. <br>
        I would say it was made much more frequently in my home than say paneer butter masala or 
        shahi paneer. <br>
        Maybe because it was considered healthier than the other creamy versions of paneer. 
        Whatever the reason was, we would always be very happy when mom made it! <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Malai Kofta is a very popular Indian vegetarian dish where balls (kofta) made of potato and paneer are deep fried and served with a creamy and spiced tomato based curry. The literal translation of this dish is malai=creamy/buttery and kofta=spiced balls (in this case made of potatoes and paneer).

        The chickpeas are cooked with Indian spices, onion-tomato paste and some coconut milk (substitute given in the recipe below), giving it a fingerpicking . <br>

We can literally have it for lunch/dinner and sometimes even for those 2 am hunger pangs. <br>

It’s also one of my favorite dishes when I’m looking at eating more of plant protein especially vegan/glutenfree – This checks all the boxes of taste, nutrition and ease. <br>
