    <p>Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around <br> the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a <br> revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, <br> cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they <br> help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.

    <h3>Top 10 Indian Vegetables Dishes</h3>

      <p>
        Chana masala recipe – Chana masala is a delicious & flavorful Indian curry made by <br>
        cooking chickpeas in a spicy onion tomato masala gravy. It can be eaten with basmati rice, <br>
        roti, naan, poori, Bhatura and plain parathas or even with flavored rice like jeera rice or ghee <br>
        rice. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        It was such a great way to sneak in the greens. They wouldn’t touch spinach otherwise but if <br>
        there was paneer with it, they would happily gulp down bowls of it. <br>
        Palak Paneer is such a staple in north India. It’s one of the most commonly made paneer <br>
        dishes in Indian homes. <br>
        I would say it was made much more frequently in my home than say paneer butter masala or <br>
        shahi paneer. <br>
        Maybe because it was considered healthier than the other creamy versions of paneer. <br>
        Whatever the reason was, we would always be very happy when mom made it! <br>
