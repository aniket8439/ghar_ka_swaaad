    <h1>Craze in India</h1>
    <img src="food.jpg" class="section"  alt="Indian Thali" >
    
    
    <p>Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around  the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a  revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom,  cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they  help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.

    <h3>Top 10 Indian Vegetables Dishes</h3>

      <li class="Chana Masala">Chana Masala</li>
      <img src="chana_masala.jpg"  class="section"  height="300" alt="Chana_Masala" >
      <p>
        Chana masala recipe – Chana masala is a delicious & flavorful Indian curry made by 
        cooking chickpeas in a spicy onion tomato masala gravy. It can be eaten with basmati rice, 
        roti, naan, poori, Bhatura and plain parathas or even with flavored rice like jeera rice or ghee 
        rice. <br>
      </p>
      

      <li class="palak_Paneer">Palak Paneer</li>
      <img src="Palak_paneer.jpg" class="section"  alt="Palak_paneer" >
      <p>
        It was such a great way to sneak in the greens. They wouldn’t touch spinach otherwise but if 
        there was paneer with it, they would happily gulp down bowls of it. <br>
        Palak Paneer is such a staple in north India. It’s one of the most commonly made paneer 
        dishes in Indian homes. <br>
        I would say it was made much more frequently in my home than say paneer butter masala or 
        shahi paneer. <br>
        Maybe because it was considered healthier than the other creamy versions of paneer. 
        Whatever the reason was, we would always be very happy when mom made it! <br>
      </p>
      <li class="Malai_Kofta">Malai Kofta</li>
      <img src="Malai-Kofta-Recipe.jpg" class="section"  alt="Malai Kofta">
      <p>
        Malai Kofta is a very popular Indian vegetarian dish where balls (kofta) made of potato and paneer are deep fried and served with a creamy and spiced tomato based curry. The literal translation of this dish is malai=creamy/buttery and kofta=spiced balls (in this case made of potatoes and paneer).
      </p>
      <li class="Shahi_Paneer">Shahi Paneer</li>
      <img src="shahi-paneer.jpg" class="section"   alt="Shahi Paneer">
      <p>
        This Shahi Paneer is deliciously rich and creamy, making it one of the most popular recipes in Mughlai cuisine. Fresh, unmelting cheese is married with a creamy gravy, perfect for serving with naan or roti. “Shahi” means “royalty,” and I can promise this dish is fit for a King! <br>
        If you are looking for a warming, comforting vegetarian dish to serve for supper, look no further. Shahi Paneer is one of my very favorite dishes and is sure to become one of yours, too. <br>
      </p>
      <li class="Chole">Chole</li>
      <img src="chole.jpg" class="section"  alt="Chole">
      <p>
        The chickpeas are cooked with Indian spices, onion-tomato paste and some coconut milk (substitute given in the recipe below), giving it a fingerpicking . <br>

We can literally have it for lunch/dinner and sometimes even for those 2 am hunger pangs. <br>

It’s also one of my favorite dishes when I’m looking at eating more of plant protein especially vegan/glutenfree – This checks all the boxes of taste, nutrition and ease. <br>

        Papdi chaat recipe With step by step photos. Papdi chaat is a popular North Indian street food made with papdi (fried flour crispies), boiled chickpeas, potatoes, pakoris (fried black gram fritters) and curd. <br>
        I still remember having Papdi chaat for the first time in a Punjabi restaurant in Delhi (can’t remember the restaurant’s name). It was one of the best papdi chaat I had in Delhi. <br>

        The dish is made with pink lentils which are known as Masoor dal in Hindi. Pink lentils are also known as red lentils and orange lentils. Note that these are not Puy lentils. <br>
        The Masoor Dal lentils can be split or whole and both types are used in the Indian cuisine. <br>
        The split and husked lentils have an orange-pink color. The Whole Masoor Dal has a dark brown color as the husks have this color. <br>

      <p>
        This Dal Makhani recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. If you love authentic Punjabi food then you are going to love this Dal Makhani even more. <br>
        Dal Makhani is one of the most popular lentil recipes from the North Indian Punjabi cuisine made with Whole Black Lentils (known as Urad dal or Kaali Dal in Hindi) and Kidney Beans (known as Rajma in Hindi). <br>
